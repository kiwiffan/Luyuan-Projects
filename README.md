Hi I am Luyuan.
Here I uploaded my personal projects both in class and in practice.
To be specific,
The Quantitive Investing Strategy shows my portfolio on the buyer side, using the Smart Beta framework and the Barra factor methodology to screen stocks.
The Time Series Models compare the accuracy and predictability between two methods, ARIMA and LSTM/GRU models.
The JS Deep Learning Model is a complete machine learning project, including data processing, model training, optimization, validation and prediction, which trained 40,000,000 data and predicted the responder according to 79 features.
